 NanoBaro-bme280-Baro-Temp-Humidy-for-OpenCPN

This Idea was originaly from:
 https://github.com/dolabriform/nanobaro_bmp280/blob/master/nanobaro_bmp280.in0

The original NanoBaro was for the bmp and is working fine.
I have a BME280 and want to utilize the additional capabilities (humidity)
This code isn't quite ready and still under development.
It is working so far, but still scrumbled with the demo code wich isn`t needed.
I've still some code from the demo and the original NanoBaro code include, but commented out.

Further develompment or help by volunteers may increase the quality of this code.
